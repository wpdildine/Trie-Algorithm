VIZIO The Sam's Club annual One-Day sale starts online at 12:01am EST and 7am in retail stores on Saturday, November 11th. Of all the pre-Black Friday sales, this one has perhaps the most merit. Many of the prices are equal to actual Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, with many being better. These deals are only eligible for members, so make sure you sign-up for a membership in advance.

Sam’s Club One-Day Sale Black Friday Tips:

Since the prices are so low on many of the products, stock will be limited and with no rain checks. Online items sell out extremely quickly so make sure you bookmark the Sam’s Club One-Day Sale page (link).

If you already know what item you want to purchase, you should bookmark it in advance and bring up that page on your computer prior to 12:01am then refresh it until you see the sale go live and purchase immediately. In the past I have seen some of the better items sold out in a few minutes.

Remember, these prices are for members only so please make sure your membership is in order prior to trying to make your purchase. You likely won’t have enough time to sign up for the membership and then buy the HDTV, PS4 or Xbox One on your list.

Not only will you receive free shipping on most items but Sam’s Club is making every effort to make this event better than the Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales from heavyweight retailers like Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart. An example of this is the iPhone deal above which was changed to make it better. Originally buyers would’ve received a $250 gift card upon activation of any iPhone, but now a $300 gift card. The iPhone X is included in these deals, which is not the case for most Black Friday deals this year.
